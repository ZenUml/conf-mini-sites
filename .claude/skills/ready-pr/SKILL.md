description: Mark a Draft PR as Ready for Review on ZenUml/conf-mini-sites so the next CI run includes E2E. Use when the user says "mark ready", "ready PR", "ready for review", "trigger e2e", "run e2e on this PR", "open it up for review", or wants to verify with E2E without committing to a merge yet. Useful mid-development when you don't want to wait until the last minute to find out if E2E passes.

# Ready PR

Flip a Draft PR to Ready for Review on `ZenUml/conf-mini-sites`. This kicks off a fresh CI run that includes the E2E job (which is gated to only run on non-Draft PRs).

## When to use

- You want E2E to verify your changes but you're not yet committing to a merge.
- You want to share the PR with a reviewer.
- The CI signal you'd otherwise wait until merge time for.

## When NOT to use

- You're ready to merge — use `/ship-branch` or `/land-pr` instead. Both auto-flip Draft → Ready as part of their flow.
- You want to rebuild without changing PR state — push an empty commit or re-run the workflow manually.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve which PR

In priority order:
1. Explicit PR number from the user (e.g. `#123`).
2. PR for the current branch: `gh pr view --json number,isDraft,headRefName`.

If no PR is found, tell the user and stop.

### 2. Check current state

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json number,isDraft,title,url --repo ZenUml/conf-mini-sites
```

If `isDraft === false`, the PR is already Ready — report that and stop. (No need to spend a CI run for nothing.)

### 3. Mark Ready

```bash
gh pr ready <PR_NUMBER> --repo ZenUml/conf-mini-sites
```

### 4. Report

Tell the user:

- The PR is now Ready for Review (with the URL).
- A new CI run should start within ~10s; it now includes the E2E job.
- Optionally suggest `/babysit-pr <PR>` to watch it.

## Does NOT

- Push commits (use `/submit-branch`)
- Wait for CI (use `/babysit-pr`)
- Merge (use `/land-pr` or `/ship-branch`)
- Convert back to Draft — that's a separate action; use `gh pr ready --undo <PR>` directly if needed
