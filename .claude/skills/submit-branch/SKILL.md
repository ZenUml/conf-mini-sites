description: Push the current branch and create or reuse a PR on ZenUml/conf-mini-sites. Use when the user says "submit", "create PR", "push and PR", "open a pull request", "submit branch", or wants to publish their work as a PR without merging. After the PR exists it always babysits CI (via babysit-pr — monitor + auto-fix). Does not merge — use land-pr for that.

# Submit Branch

Publish the current branch as a pull request on `ZenUml/conf-mini-sites`, then babysit its CI. Reuses an existing PR if one already exists for this branch.

> **No git remote yet.** This repo has no `origin` configured, so push and PR steps below will fail until you add one:
> ```bash
> git remote add origin git@github.com:ZenUml/conf-mini-sites.git
> ```
> Replace `OWNER` with the real GitHub org/user once the repo is created on GitHub.

**Tip:** Run `/validate-branch` first to catch typecheck, test, and build failures before pushing.

## Preconditions

The worktree must be in a committable state:

- **Clean worktree** — nothing to commit, just push. This is the ideal case.
- **Scoped changes** — all modified files relate to the current work. Stage and commit them.
- **Mixed/unrelated changes** — modified files include unrelated work. **Stop and ask the user** which files to include. Never auto-commit a mixed worktree.

To check: `git status` and review the file list. If in doubt, ask.

## Steps

### 1. Check worktree state

```bash
git status
```

If dirty, evaluate whether changes are scoped (all related to the branch's purpose) or mixed. If mixed, stop and ask.

If scoped, stage the relevant files and commit with a descriptive message. Follow the repo's commit conventions (one-line message, Co-Authored-By trailer).

### 2. Push

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Use regular push — never force-push. If push fails due to upstream changes, report the conflict and stop. If push fails because no `origin` remote exists, add it (see the note above) and retry.

### 3. Create or reuse PR

Check if a PR already exists:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,url 2>/dev/null
```

If a PR exists, note its URL and **proceed to Step 4** (babysit it). Do not stop here.

If no PR exists, create one targeting `master` **as Draft**:

```bash
gh pr create --base master --draft --title "<concise title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullet points>

## Test plan
<what was tested>
EOF
)"
```

**Why Draft:** the CI workflow can skip the slower E2E jobs on Draft PRs, so you can iterate on the branch without paying the E2E cost on every push. When you want E2E to run, use `/ready-pr` (verify only) or `/ship-branch` / `/land-pr` (which auto-flip as part of merging).

If the user explicitly says "submit as ready" or "open as ready", omit `--draft`.

### 4. Babysit CI (always)

After the PR exists (created or reused), **always** babysit its CI by invoking the `babysit-pr` skill with the PR number:

```
/babysit-pr <PR_NUMBER>
```

This monitors the CI run, diagnoses any failure, and attempts fixes (up to 3 attempts). For a **Draft** PR it expects build + unit tests to pass and the E2E job to be skipped — that skip is by design, not a failure. Do not stop at "PR created"; carry through until babysit-pr reports PASSED or exhausts its retry budget.

Skip this step only if the user explicitly said "submit only" / "don't babysit" / "just push".

## Output

Report:

- **SUBMITTED** — PR number, URL, branch name, whether it was opened as Draft (note "mark Ready for Review when you want E2E to run"), **and the babysit-pr result** (PASSED / failures + fixes / retries exhausted).
- **FAILED** — what went wrong (dirty worktree, push conflict, missing remote, gh error).

## Does NOT

- Run tests or typecheck before pushing (use `/validate-branch` for that)
- Merge the PR (use `/land-pr` for that)

CI fixing is delegated to `babysit-pr` in Step 4, not done by this skill directly.
